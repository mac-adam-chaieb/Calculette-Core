The Scientrix Calculator is an effort to build a simple-to-use calculator with great scientific features and matrix capabilities.

Most of the structure is inspired by the Jam Programming Language, and Scientrix could even be seen as a Jam sub-language that could potentially be incorporated in Jam in the future.

Operations that are supported (or will be supported in the future):

+   Addition
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
/   Division
mod Remainder
^   Power
abs Absolute Value
