The Scientrix Calculator is an effort to build a simple-to-use calculator with great scientific features and matrix capabilities.

Most of the structure is inspired by the Jam Programming Language, and Scientrix could even be seen as a Jam sub-language that could potentially be incorporated in Jam in the future.
