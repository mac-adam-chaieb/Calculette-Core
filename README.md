The Scientrix Calculator is an effort to build a simple-to-use calculator with great scientific features and matrix capabilities.

Most of the structure is inspired by the Jam Programming Language, and Scientrix could even be seen as a Jam sub-language that could potentially be incorporated in Jam in the future.

Operations that are supported (or will be supported in the future):

- +   Addition / Identity
- -   Subtraction / Negation
- *   Multiplication
- /   Division
- mod Remainder
- ^   Power
- sqrt Square Root
- inv Inverse
- abs Absolute Value
- log Decimal lograrithm
- ln  Natural logarithm
- lb Binary Logarithm
- cos Cosine
- sin Sine
- tan Tangent
- arcos Inverse cosine
- arcsin Inverse sine
- arctan Inverse tangent
- len Number of digits
- max Maximum
- min Minimum
- floor Round down
- ceil Round up
- sig Signum
- gcd Greatest Common Divisor
- lcm Least Common Multiple
- ! Factorial
- P Permutations
- C Combinations
- det Matrix Determinant
- inv Matrix inverse
- cof Cofactors matrix
- adj Adjoint matrix
- T   Transpose
